# Wrapper-Functions

A wrapper function is a function that encapsulates another function, modifying or extending its behavior. 
It is commonly used to add additional functionality, such as logging, error handling, or input validation, before or after the execution of the original function.

The primary purpose of the wrapper_malloc function is to extend the functionality of the standard malloc function by adding additional layers of error handling, monitoring, and customization. By wrapping malloc, you can centralize certain tasks related to memory allocation, making your code more robust, maintainable, and consistent.
